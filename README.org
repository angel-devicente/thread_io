* MPI I/O with threads

Test code to implement I/O in MPI via a dedicated thread in process 0.

The idea here is that process 0 creates a thread that is continuously in a loop
waiting for messages from all processes (including process 0 itself, in the
original thread), that might arrive at any time and not necessarily the same
number of them from every process.

** Compilation of test code

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
$ mpicc  -o test_t thread_io.c test.c
#+END_SRC

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
mpirun -np 16 ./test_t
#+END_SRC

or if run in a cluster, see file /submit.sh/


** To do

Parameterize number of messages printed from every process and add an option to
perform random "sleeps" in processes to study the behaviour of possible
race conditions.
